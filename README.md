# Generate HTML page
In this assignment you will open up `HtmlPageGeneratorApp.java` and add code to add HTML tags to a HTML document.
You are engcouraged to use loops and lists, to see how generating HTML pages with code is less tedious than writing the
code by hand. For instance you can use a `for` loop or `for each` loop to add the same or almost the same thing over and
over again to a list (look into `<ul>`, `<ol>` and `<li>` tags). Here are some other commonly used HTML tags: 
`<p>`, `<img>` and `<table>`. You can look at the class `UtilityFunctions` for some ideas of content you can put in your
page, if you want. You can start using one of the lists and then see if you can combine them in a single HTML 
list or table.


## Why would you want to generate a HTML page using code instead of just writing the HTML page by hand directly?
There are many reasons. One is that you often display information that depends on what user is logged in, so different
users will see different content. Another is that when reading information from a database, you want to add the same 
HTML code for each of the rows in the database results.
